### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**TrevorDewalt/TrevorDewalt** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Human Rights First- Asylum Porject
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning something new everyday.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects where I can learn something new or polish a current skill. 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. You can always ask, you just may not get an answer. 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: trevor.dewalt@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I backpacked Central America (from Costa Rica to Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico) solo a month after turning 17 years old.
