### Hi there, Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Human Rights First- Asylum Project
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning something new everyday. Knowledge compounds just like dollars. Try it out. Thank me later. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects where I can learn something new or polish a current skill. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. You can always ask, you just may not get an answer. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: trevor.dewalt@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I backpacked Central America (from Costa Rica to Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico) SOLO a month after turning 17 years old.
